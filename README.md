# Algorithms
Some interesting algorithms implemented in Python
## Currently have:
- von Emde Boas tree for fast lookup
- Manacher algorithm for finding longest palidromic sequence
- Skip list, a O(log(n)) time random access linked list
- A puzzle solver by Raymond Hettinger shown in pyCon 19
- A minimal Char RNN by Andrej
